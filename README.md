# InfoVisualisation
This is the Unity project that was created as part of a UROS research project regarding Information Visualisation in Virtual Reality environments at the University of Lincoln.

This is a simple VR game where waves of enemies attack the player who much shoot them with fireballs to survive.

The research project is to look into ways of displaying information to users in a virtual reality environment without breaking immersion. Since traditional HUD elements do not often work in a contextual or immersive way in virtual reality, this game was made to use as a test platform for a study into providing more immersive and/or contextual ways for displaying information.
