# InfoVisualisation
This is the Unity project being used as part of a UROS research project regarding Information Visualisation in Virtual Reality environments at the University of Lincoln.

The research project is to look into ways of displaying information to users in a virtual reality environment without breaking immersion. Since traditional HUD elements do not often work in a contextual or immersive way in virtual reality, this game was made to use as a test platform for a study into providing more immersive and/or contextual ways for displaying information.
